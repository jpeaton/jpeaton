**About Me**

ðŸ‘‹ Hi , I'm **Jeremiah Eaton**, and I'm a Software Engineer in training at DePaul University. I'm originally from Northwest Indiana but now reside in Chicago.

I'm still currently in my intro-level learning phase and have been doing a lot of intro courses to start understanding enough to create my own projects. I graduated with a Liberal Arts degree for my Undergrad, providing me with strong problem solving and critical thinking skills.
